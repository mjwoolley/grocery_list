# Grocery List App Requirements

## High-Level Description
This is a simple grocery list app designed for shared use between you and your wife. It will be primarily a web app that you access via a shortcut on your phones, formatted for mobile screens.

## Version 1 (MVP) Features

### Core Functionality
- Users can add items to a shared grocery list using a simple text field
- Items can be checked off as purchased and immediately disappear from main list
- Checked items move to a "purchased items" section below the main list
- Purchased items remain visible until manually cleared
- "Clear All Purchased Items" button to remove all purchased items
- Real-time syncing so both users see updates instantly

### User Management
- Each user has their own Firebase Authentication login (email/password)
- Both users share access to the same grocery list
- Equal permissions: either user can add, check off, or delete items added by the other
- Either user can clear purchased items

### Interface
- Single shared grocery list (no multiple lists)
- Minimal, clean interface (Google-style simplicity)
- Mobile-first design for phone usage
- Standard tap interactions (no special gestures)
- Online-only functionality (requires internet connection)

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built with React for the web app
- **Styling**: Use Material-UI for pre-built components
- **Backend**: Using Firebase for both the database and hosting. No need for a separate Node backend; the React app will communicate directly with Firebase
- **Database**: Using Firebase Realtime Database (NoSQL) for real-time updates
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for email/password login with separate accounts for each user
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting for the frontend, with the option to add a custom domain
- **Deployment**: Can integrate with GitHub Actions for automated deployments

## Future Enhancements (Post-V1)

### Input Methods
- Voice input capability for adding items
- Auto-suggestions from previously added items
- Frequently purchased items quick-add list

### Mobile Experience  
- Progressive Web App (PWA) installation capability
- Offline functionality with sync when reconnected
- Mobile gestures (swipe actions, etc.)

### Organization
- Store aisle categorization (specifically for Giant store layout)
- Multiple lists capability (different stores, purposes)

### Notifications
- Real-time notifications when items are added by the other user

### Enhanced Features
- Item history and analytics
- Shopping reminders or location-based notifications

## Additional Considerations
- Robust error handling throughout the application
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for phone screens
- Clean, intuitive user experience suitable for quick grocery shopping use
